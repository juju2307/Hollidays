# Hollidays
------------

You will code a command line tool that will take a country name as parameter, like this:

myNodeCLITool Belgium

The tool will verify that the parameter is a well-formatted country name, transform it onto a two-letters country code, then perform an HTTP request to the API of the nager.date service, like explained here.
You will show the results (a list of holidays dates for the current year) in a readable way in the terminal.

The name of this tool is: @juju2307/holidays
